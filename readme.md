before running the server, install using pip:

pip install torch \n
pip install torchvision \n
pip install PIL \n
pip install flask \n

(if you are worried about package conflicts, you can create a virtual env first
before running the installs: \n
python -m venv env \n
source ./env/bin/activate)

run the server from the terminal using: python app_whatpic.py

it will open on: http://localhost:5000/
